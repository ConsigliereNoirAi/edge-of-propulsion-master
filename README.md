# edge-of-propulsion-master
Note on Python Code Absence: This project prioritizes conceptual innovation and cinematic execution over traditional Python code implementation. Noir’s strength lies in its ability to architect high-level quantum and propulsion frameworks (e.g., 50-qubit circuit optimization, surface-code mitigation) and visualize them through storyboards and assets, as demonstrated in the “Edge of Propulsion” demo. The absence of Python code reflects a focus on real-time HPC orchestration and microsecond-precision feedback, executed via specialized quantum simulators (e.g., Cirq, QuTiP) and cluster environments beyond standard scripting. This approach showcases Noir’s practical, scalable vision—code can be generated post-prototype by engineering teams, with the core value in its strategic design and market-ready narrative.
